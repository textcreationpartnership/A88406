            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Prince also led a Troope of Horse consisting of 150 Knights, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires and Gentlemen, some whereof had foure, some three; and most two men a peece, which made another Troope.</p>

His Speech being ended, he rode round the Moore, and about the number of 65000. followed him, crying all the way (God blesse the King,) but the rest which were about 5000. all Free-holders, separated themselves to Petition to his Majesty, and had their Petition ready to present to him, the effect of it, was to beseech his Majesty to come to the Parliament, &amp;c. but their Petition was intercepted by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            </opener>
            <p>RIght trustie and wel-beloved Cousins, and Councellers, we greet you Well. Although We have already Written Our minde to you Our Councell; yet upon Our second thoughts, arising especially from some bad rumours, coming to our knowledge, finde it necessarie both for Our Selfe, and for the good of that Our Kingdome, to declare, and make known both Our disposition and desires more fully.</p>
            <p>We know and feel the charge to be great, and the place to be high, wherein God (the King of kings) hath placed Us, and that We must render an accompt of all Our actions to him, who in his own time shall judge all men without exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of persons. We have no other intentions, but by Our government to honour him by whom Kings raign, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the good of Our People: and for this end to preserve the right and authoritie wherewith God hath vested Us, and
<pb facs="tcp:156785:5"/>which by his Providence hath been derived to Us, by many Princely progenitors: in the which glory, that Our ancient Kingdome, and native Realm of <hi>Scotlaud</hi> doth participate.</p>
            <p>We did not require of you, that you should sit as Judges upon the affairs of another Kingdome: We only intended to have both Our sufferings &amp; Our actions, (as they are exprest in many papers past betwixt Us and Our parliament) made throughly known unto you: that since We have none besides you whom wee can acquaint with Our proceedings, you may clearly see that We have been so far from wronging Our Parliament of England, that we have given them all satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, even above that which they themselvs in the beginning did expresse, or almost desire: and as much as could well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with safety of our person and Honor. We will not put you in minde of your naturall affection toward Us, which We know will rather be kindled then extinguished by Our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse: Nor of your Covenant, wherein you are zealous of Greatnesse and Authority, and wich standeth in that sense wherein you did sweare and subscribe it: Nor of any good Lawes made in Our late Parliament (of which We hope the present and succeeding generations shall reap the fruits, when We are dead and gone:) Nor of any promises made unto Us, Upon which We were willing to yeild to such things for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the government of that our kingdome, in Our personall absence which neither could We have granted, nor would you have craved (as your selves did professe) had our greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires permitted Our residence amongst you. And whereas We are most unjustly blamed and calumniated, 1. That We are popishly affected: 2. That we are the cause of the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in <hi>Ireland.</hi> 3. That we intend to bring in forraign for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: We here do protest and declare in presence of him who knowes the most secret of Our intentions and actions, that We are no wayes conscious to Our Self of the guiltinesse of any of the said aspersions: and do take him to witnesse Our innocency therein, who onely hath the priviledge to be the searcher of ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
